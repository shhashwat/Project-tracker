# Project-tracker

The vendor file is split into two parts due to it's size being too large for a single file upload. Instead I have split the vendor folder into two parts, you can copy and paste the contents of either of the folder (after unzipping them) and can form one cohesive vendor folder. Rename the folder back to 'vendor' and migrate it back to the main/root project tracker folder to run the application.
